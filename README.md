# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this deliverable is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. This will fill senior level positions as they become open to help Pewlett-Hackard prepare for a projected large number of employees retiring. Filling these positions through a mentorship program will help a smooth transition overtime.

## Results

- There are 90,398 employees projected to retire in the near future. 
- Of the 90,398 projected retirements, they are spanning across 7 position titles.
- There are 1549 employees eligible for the mentorship program (see disbursement below).

## Summary

- There are plenty of "qualified retirement ready employees" in the departments to mentor the next generation.
- One additional table is looking at the salaries of retiring employees. This will help forecast what they will see on the P&L in coming years. 
- An additional query on the salaries of retiring employees would be expected pay increases for employees in the mentorship program.
